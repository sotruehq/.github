# SotrueHQ Code of Conduct

We want SotrueHQ projects to be welcoming, respectful and safe for everyone.

- Be respectful and professional in all interactions.
- Assume good intent but be clear and direct when giving feedback.
- No harassment, hate speech or personal attacks.
- Keep discussions focused on the work, not the person.
- Respect different time zones and working styles.

If you experience or witness unacceptable behavior:

- You can contact the maintainers privately via email or internal channels.
- Provide as much context as you are comfortable sharing.

Maintainers may take appropriate action, including warnings, blocking or removal from a project, if behavior violates this code of conduct.
