# Contributing to SotrueHQ Projects

Thanks for your interest in contributing to Sotrue!

This document describes general guidelines that apply to most repositories under the `sotruehq` organization. Individual repos may have additional details in their own `CONTRIBUTING.md`.

---

## How to Propose Changes

1. **Create an issue first**  
   - Bug? Use the "Bug report" template.  
   - Feature? Use the "Feature request" template.  
   - Chore/refactor? Use the "Chore / Task" template.

2. **Branch naming**

Use a clear, consistent naming convention:

- `feat/<short-description>` – new features  
- `fix/<short-description>` – bug fixes  
- `chore/<short-description>` – maintenance / refactors  
- `docs/<short-description>` – documentation updates

Examples:

- `feat/mobile-login-screen`
- `fix/backend-content-pagination`

3. **Pull requests**

- Small, focused PRs are easier to review.
- Link the related issue (e.g. `Closes #123`).
- Make sure:
  - Tests are updated/added where relevant.
  - Linting passes locally.

---

## Code Style

- Use **TypeScript** where possible for new code.
- Follow the repo’s ESLint / Prettier configuration.
- Keep functions and components small and readable.
- Use meaningful names for variables, functions and components.

---

## Communication

- Prefer async communication via GitHub issues & PR comments.
- Be respectful and concise.
- If something is unclear, ask questions early rather than guessing.

---

## Security

If you find a security issue, **do not** open a public issue.  
Follow the process described in [`SECURITY.md`](./SECURITY.md).
