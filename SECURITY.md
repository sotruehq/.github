# Security Policy

## Supported Projects

This security policy applies to all active repositories under the `sotruehq` organization, unless a specific repository specifies otherwise.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you believe you have found a security vulnerability:

1. **Do not create a public GitHub issue.**
2. Contact the maintainers privately via email or internal company channels.
3. Include:
   - A description of the vulnerability.
   - Steps to reproduce.
   - Any potential impact you see.
   - Suggested fixes or mitigations (if any).

We will:

- Acknowledge your report as soon as we can.
- Investigate and verify the issue.
- Work on a fix and coordinate a release.
- Credit you appropriately if desired (and if policies allow).

Thank you for helping keep Sotrue users and systems safe.
